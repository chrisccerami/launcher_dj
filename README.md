Hey guys, Chris W here. I'm replacing this file with a proposed feature list for
this project. Everyone should feel free to contribute ideas for new features /
next steps by adding them to this file and then pushing it to the master:

Get OmniAuth/Github working
  [this will also require rewriting the database to save user info]

Clean up front end (remove song id #, generally make pretty)

Integrate the Youtube API to create playlists

Add other views (by user?)
